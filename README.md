# steam-table-ann
Steam table is extremely used in all the thermodynamic applications. Apart from table we studied is our school days, there are so many software tools available to get the value of required thermodynamic property at given temperature or pressure. 
Most of them have steam table dataset available and missing values can be found using interpolation. Here, The idea of artificial neural network is implemented on steam table. That is, why can't we predict the required parameter using ANN?
We trained model using 70% dataset from steam table and tried remaining data for testing purpose.
Results are in agreement and error is minimal. So we can also use this in our real life.
